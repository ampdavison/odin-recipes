    <h4>This fresh flour tortilla recipe will have you howling for all sorts of fillings.</h4>
    <p>This easy-to-follow recipe requires minimal effort and maybe 30min to an hour of wait time as the dough rests.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup Neutral Oil (generic vegetable oil)</li>

        <li>1 Cup Hot Water (not boiling)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together
                flour, salt, and baking powder. With the mixer running on medium, add in oil then the water (not all at once)
                until a smooth dough forms, about 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured cutting board and divide into equal parts (usually about 12-16).</li>
            <li>Roll each unit into a ball and flatten slightly.</li>
            <li>Let dough rest for 30 minutes under a kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Heat up a kitchen skillet (cast iron if you have one) over medium.</li>
            <li>While the skillet heats, use a rolling pin and flatten the tortilla dough balls into a thin round shape (you can experiment with thickness over time).</li>
            <li>Cook each tortilla for about 2 minutes, flip and cook for another 1 minute. Flip one last time and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked tortillas to a plate or basket lined with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Aprovecho!</li>
