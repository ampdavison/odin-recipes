<p>This simple carne asada recipe will leave your taste buds tingling. The only question you'll be left with is 'how can I drink another beer with my stomach this full?'</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>2lbs. Flank Steak</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 Orange</li>
    <li>Juice of 2 Limes</li>
    <li>1/4 Cup Light Beer</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>1 Large White Onion Sliced (optional)</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil (coat the grill irons)</li>
</ul></p>    
<p>
    <strong>Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flank steak in a large deep-rimmed dish. Sprinkle generously with salt and freshly ground pepper taking care to pat the s&p into your meat. If using the onion, spread the slices over the meat. Let rest 20 min.</li>
        <li>In medium-sized mixing bowl, mix together all wet ingredients. Pour the marinade over the meat, cover and refridgerate at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready, remove from the refridgerator and let stand 30 minutes. While coming to room temp, light up your grill; and, once hot, prep the grill irons by rubbing a paper towel coated with vegetable oil over the hot surface.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry. Place meat on the grill and cook according to your preferences (about 4min per side for medium-rare).</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from heat and let rest another 5 minutes before slicing. REMEMBER, it is especially important to slice against the grain for flank steak. Identify the direction of the muscle fibers and slice perpendicularly. Following this step will make for the best possible chewing/eating experience.</li>
        <li>Serve with fresh flour tortillas and toppings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
